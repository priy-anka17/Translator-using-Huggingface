# 🌐 Translation Project

Welcome to the **Translation Project**, a Python-based application that leverages Hugging Face’s `transformers` library to translate text between multiple languages. This project demonstrates how to implement machine translation using pre-trained language models.

## 🚀 Features

- **Multi-language support**: Translate text between English and French, Hindi, Spanish, German, and Chinese.
- **Bidirectional translation**: Supports translation from English to other languages and vice versa.
- **Pre-trained models**: Utilizes state-of-the-art, pre-trained models from Hugging Face, ensuring accurate and high-quality translations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Hugging Face `transformers`**
- **PyTorch (`torch`)**
- **Sacremoses** (for tokenization)

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Hugging Face `transformers` library
- `torch` for deep learning
- `sacremoses` for tokenization

## 🌍 Supported Translations

The project currently supports the following language pairs:

- **English ➡️ French**
- **English ➡️ Hindi**
- **English ➡️ Spanish**
- **English ➡️ German**
- **English ➡️ Chinese**
- **All supported languages ➡️ English**

## 💡 Future Enhancements

In the future, the following improvements are planned:

- **Add more languages**: Extend support to additional languages.
- **Command-line interface (CLI)**: Implement an easy-to-use CLI for seamless interaction.
- **Web API deployment**: Provide a REST API for translation, enabling use in web applications.
